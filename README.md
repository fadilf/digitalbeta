# Freecycle Dubai

Freecycling is the practice of giving away items that are no longer necessary to the owner. There are global communities of Freecycling groups around the world, though such a group is lacking in Dubai. Because of this, I created an app as my Digital Design project that allows users to post listings online for various things that they no longer need as well as requests for things that they require that others might have.
